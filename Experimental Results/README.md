This repository contains folders representing the fault attack experimental results conducted using the ChipWhisperer Lite setup. The experiments were carried out on two different target boards:
1. STM32F3 (32-bit ARM Cortex)
2. XMEGA (8-bit AVR)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each folder corresponds to experiments targeting one of the above platforms. 

1. 'stm32f3/': Fault injection results on the STM32F3 target.
2. 'xmega/': Fault injection results on the XMEGA target.

Files containing 'FF' in their names refer to Fixed Fault (FF) experiments.

All experiments were conducted using the ChipWhisperer-Lite platform with appropriate glitch and trigger configurations. 
Please refer to the individual subfolders for more details about the corresponding experimental results and output files.
